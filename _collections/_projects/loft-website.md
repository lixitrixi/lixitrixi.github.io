Alongside my University studies I have been working part-time for [Loft Design](https://loft.design), a Providence-based design firm. My main role at the company has been to maintain their website through Webflow, turning ideas from the designers into working web pages.

Working with a WYSIWYG editor like Webflow as a front-end developer has at times been a challenge, as I've felt my freedom to code whatever I need has been restricted. The platform is very useful, however, for people who just want to create and publish content like blog posts and case studies. In this way Webflow has empowered me to do the important technical stuff like creating a certain interactive element, and then step out of the way to let others populate it with actual content.

My time at the company has given me much-needed experience with communicating technical ideas, adhering to design specifications, and creating and following realistic timelines. This experience has been indespensable for all of my subsequence projects and work!
