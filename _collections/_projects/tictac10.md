This was my first proper dive into AI! After being unable to beat a level involving a 10x10 version of tic-tac-toe on a game I was playing ([Machinarium](https://amanita-design.net/games/machinarium.html)), I decided to simply build an AI that could beat it.

While working on the program, a good motivator was how well it worked. The AI went from making very bad moves and being laughed at (warmly) by my dad to consistently beating him at the game.

While the final product lacked some things, the process taught me a lot of software practices, like recursion, and gave me more experience. I was able to use what I had learned from this and similar projects later during my coursework where 2 other team members and myself build a [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) AI with an exceptionally aggressive and precise heuristic for pruning possible next moves.
