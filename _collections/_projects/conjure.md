Conjure is an application which allows specifying complex computational problems in a natural language and quickly solving them using various methods and techniques. It's been maintained for nearly a decade by several professors and PhD/Masters students at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), and was opened up as a [Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/education/vip/) in 2023.

I worked as part of a 7-person team on various projects within the Conjure "ecosystem" during my two semesters on the VIP. My time on the project saw me writing tons of code in a newly-learned language (Rust), regularly presenting my ideas and progress to the larger team, writing [documentation for the engine](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-oxide/wiki/Semantics-of-Rewriting-Expressions-with-Side%E2%80%90Effects), and learning a lot about Constraint Programming and AST expression semantics.

My end-of-semester report listing my contributions is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rwrckzhfqwbg#e0391f).
