Ropes was a lightweight physics simulation built in Pygame, inspired by *Polybridge* and a video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague). The simulation used just two basic elements—nodes and sticks—to model a surprisingly wide range of physical systems.

Despite its simplicity, the system could simulate various dynamic structures, including pivots, catapults, and even cloth-like behavior.

The project was an excellent hands-on introduction to constraint-based physics and demonstrated how complex motion can emerge from simple rules.
