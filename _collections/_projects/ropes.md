Ropes is a simple physics simulation I created in Pygame with inspiration from the game [Polybridge](https://polybridgegame.com/) and a video by YouTuber [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague). It uses two simple objects - a node and a stick - to create complex movement.

Using these two simple objects, the program can simulate physical objects like pivots, catapults, and even cloth!
