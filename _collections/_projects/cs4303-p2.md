This game was my final project for CS4303, a module on video game development. The first submission was focused on game AI: I created two friendly creature types which mine for and protect the player, as well as a hostile AI creature which attacks them.

Due to the nature of the course I was able to update my project for the final submission, which was focused on procedural content generation. While the first game had used a hard-coded map, this time I was able to use Perlin noise to create a natural-looking and fun map to dig around in.

This project taught me a lot about proper structuring of code in a game-dev context as well as how interesting video games can be as a usability and design challenge.
