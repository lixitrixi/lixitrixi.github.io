Gaia was a 2 year long political roleplay I was a part of together with 5 other people. Each member played the part of a country on a fictional planet called Gaia, drafting treaties, expanding territories, and developing technologies. In the late stage of the game, we even travelled to other planets to establish colonies.

Although I hadn't had much interest in the 4X games (Civilization, Hearts of Iron, etc.) that the game was based on, I found myself very invested. I made flags for my country, the "Miferan Federation", and created some landscapes of interplanetary views. For my art, I mostly used [Gravit](designer.io), a free vector graphics app. Below is some of the content I created.

<img src="/assets/img/pustivica.png" width="500px">
<cap>The flag of Miferia's interplanetary colony, Pustivica. The colony is located on Habiis, a nearby habitable planet.</cap>

<img src="/assets/img/atlas.png" width="500px">
<cap>The flag I designed for ATLAS, an alliance among 3 countries, Miferia included, dedicated to stopping nuclear proliferation. The 3 pillars bearing each of our flags is meant to represent international stability and peace.</cap>

<img src="/assets/img/research.png" width="800px">
<cap>Players were able to write up to 2 original "research discoveries" per day, which would grant them points they could use for various benefits to their interplanetary programs. These are two very different discoveries I wrote one day during a period of a few weeks where I aimed to write 2 pieces every day.</cap>
