Singularity Solutions was my first web design project, completed for a school English project. Instead of using web design tools like Wix or Weebly like the rest of my class, I decided to test my skills and built a site from scratch.

I had very little idea how CSS worked (and how amazing `display:flex` is), and so the final product was a little crude. I had a lot of fun working on a real site though, and it taught me a lot about how web pages are structured.
