I've always been interested in game development. It was, after all, the medium that first got me into programming through [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). While my knowledge of programming has grown a lot, my art skills have not, and so I took it upon myself to learn some pixel art. Through amazing sources like [Adam Younis](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamCYounis), an indie game dev, I learned a bit more about this retro art style. Below are some of the results of my explorations.
