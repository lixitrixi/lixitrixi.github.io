Arpeggio was a custom Discord music bot and my first large-scale personal project that I carried through to completion. It played audio tracks in voice channels and supported playback from YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify. More than just a technical milestone, Arpeggio also marked my first experience engaging with other developers online.

The initial version was a simple set of Python scripts deployed to a Google Cloud VM, which helped me understand how Python libraries and web servers worked in practice. Later, I migrated the project to the same web server that hosted my personal website, where I actively maintained and improved it. Over time, Arpeggio expanded from a few friendsâ€™ servers to over 50 active Discord servers.

Though Arpeggio is no longer running, it was a formative project that taught me valuable lessons in project management, server deployment, and real-world API integration. Seeing friends regularly use it as they would a mainstream music bot made the effort deeply rewarding and sparked my long-term interest in building networked applications.
