Arpeggio is an automated Discord user account ("bot") that plays audio tracks and music in voice channels. It was my first larger project that I saw through to completion, and was also my first introduction to talking with other developers online.

My first version of Arpeggio was a few files that I copied to and ran on a GCP machine. It taught me a lot about Python libraries as well as how web servers actually work. I then moved it to the web server that hosted my website and continuously updated and maintained it, seeing it grow from a handful of Discord servers with my friends to <b>52</b> servers today! It supports SoundCloud and Spotify as well as YouTube playback.

Although Arpeggio is no longer online, the project taught me a lot about effective project management and the technical side of the Internet. Seeing all of my friends use it regularly like they would a more popular music bot was very rewarding and whet my appetite for online projects.
