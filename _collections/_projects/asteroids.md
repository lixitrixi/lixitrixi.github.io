This was an Asteroids clone I made during my Junior year of high school and revisited in my Computer Science class during my final year.

Both the asteroids and the player's ship are represented as collections of polar coordinates that are then converted to vertices in cartesian coordinates. This allows for easy rotation and scaling. Asteroid vertices are random, leading to realistic rocky surfaces. Together with slow rotation, this creates a nice final look on screen.

I also implemented a simple UI in the form of main, options, and pause menus. The end result was a very playable game that I let some of my friends in my CS class try. Very rewarding!
