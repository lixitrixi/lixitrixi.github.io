This project began as a personal challenge during my junior year of high school and was later refined as part of my final-year Computer Science class. The game is a modern take on the classic Asteroids, featuring a fully playable experience with responsive controls and a simple UI, including main, options, and pause menus.

Both the player’s ship and the asteroids are defined using polar coordinates, which are then converted to Cartesian vertices for rendering. This approach allowed for smooth rotation and dynamic scaling. Asteroid shapes are generated with randomized vertex offsets, creating a natural, rocky appearance that slowly rotates on screen—resulting in a satisfying visual effect.

The final product was a fun, fully functional game that I shared with classmates for feedback and testing. It was a great early experience in interactive graphics programming and game design, and one I really enjoyed building.
