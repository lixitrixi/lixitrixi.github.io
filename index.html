<h1>Hi, I'm Felix!</h1>

<p class="mb-4">I’m a software developer studying at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of St Andrews</a> in Scotland. I’m interested in many different areas of CS, especially algorithms and full-stack web design/development.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I'm currently interning at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/" target="_blank">MathWorks</a> in Cambridge, England, working on software and platform testing. I previously interned at <a href="https://www.savant.com" target="_blank">Savant Systems</a> and <a href="https://www.trackx.tech/" target="_blank">TrackX Technology</a>; for more details see my <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>

<p class="mb-4">I enjoy maintaining and contributing to open-source projects, both in my free time and as part of my degree:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/conjure-cp" target="_blank">Conjure</a> - A research project focused on automated decision making and problem solving.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/conjure-cp/uniplate" target="_blank">Uniplate</a> - A Rust library for manipulating tree-like structures.</li>
</ul>
